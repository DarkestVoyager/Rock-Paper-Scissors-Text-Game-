# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Text-Game-
I made this simple Rock Paper Scissors Text Game in C++. You play against the computer, each one of you chooses one of the 3 options.
The Score is also tracked and the overall winner is shown when you chose to not continue to play.
After each round the terminal is cleared, and so when the overall score and winner is displayed.
